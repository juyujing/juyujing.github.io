I'm Yujing Ju (*pronounced as: Yoo-jing Joo [tɕy˥ y˧˥ tɕiŋ˥˩]*), currently pursuing a dual degree in Robotics at Heriot-Watt University and Computer Science at Ocean University of China. My academic and professional journey is defined by a passion for interdisciplinary research, combining machine learning, graph mining, and robotics to solve complex real-world problems.

## Highlights
- **Directed Graph Modeling**: Improved academic citation recommendations by capturing overlooked directional relationships.
- **Biomimetic Robotics**: Developed a hexapod robot capable of efficient locomotion and object grasping using YOLO-based detection and motion planning.  
- **Hypergraph Modeling**: Enhanced group recommendation accuracy by using hypergraph probability matrix.
- **Open Source Contributions**: Collaborated on [graph-based mathematical model integration](https://github.com/GNNIP/GNNIP) as part of a Florida State University research internship.

## My Projects
Here are a few of my key research contributions:

1. [Academic Recommendation System](https://github.com/juyujing/CitationNN)  
   Developed a module that captures directed interaction effectively and apply it to academic recommendation system through heterogeneous directed edge modeling directed citation relationship.
2. [Hexapod Robot for Object Capturing](https://github.com/juyujing/Capturer)  
   Designed a lightweight, bio-inspired hexapod robot with advanced motion planning and vision-based recognition.
3. [Hypergraph Modeling for Group Recommendations](https://github.com/juyujing/HyperGCN)  
   Introduced hypergraph probability matrix that captures higher-order interactions in group-buying scenarios.
4. [Open Source GNNIP Library](https://github.com/GNNIP/GNNIP)  
   Contributed to a open source project integrating graph structure based modeling algorithms and enchencing computational efficiency.  

## Skills
While my CV contains a full breakdown of skills, here's a brief snapshot:
- **Machine Learning**: Expertise in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.  
- **Robotics Development**: Proficient in ROS, SLAM (VINS-Fusion, FAST-LIO), and NVIDIA Jetson platforms.  
- **Data Science Tools**: Familiarity with Pandas, Numpy, and Matlab.  
- **Programming**: Advanced in Python, C, and C++.
