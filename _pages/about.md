I'm **Yujing Ju** (pronounced as: *Yoo-jing Joo* [tɕy˥ y˧˥ tɕiŋ˥˩]), holding a Bachelor of Engineering degree in **Robotics** with First-Class Award at [**Heriot-Watt University**](https://www.hw.ac.uk), where I am advised by [Prof. Wei Pang](https://pangwei.eu.org/).

[//]: # (
In Fall 2025, I will begin my **Doctor of Philosophy in AI/ML (Biomedical Applications)** at the [**University of Florida**](https://www.ufl.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Mei Liu](https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/profile/liu-mei/).

My academic and professional journey is defined by a passion for **interdisciplinary research**, combining **Statistics**, **Topology**, **Computational Mathematics**, and **Robotics** to solve complex real-world problems — with focus on applications in **Medicine** and **Recommendation Systems**.

In Fall 2025, I will begin my Doctor of Philosophy in AI/ML at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Mei Liu](https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/profile/liu-mei/).

My research advances machine learning by developing novel approaches to **representation learning and embedding optimization**. 

I design **architectures for large language models, graph neural networks, and diffusion models** that integrate structural innovations and topological reasoning, enabling models to capture complex relational and latent patterns. These methods are applied to **large-scale, privacy-sensitive electronic health records** and **recommendation system**, producing scalable, robust, and high-performing solutions for challenging real-world problems.


## Highlights
- **Directed Graph Modeling**: Improved academic paper recommendation precision by capturing overlooked directional citation relationships.
- **Biomimetic Robotics**: Developed a hexapod robot capable of efficient locomotion and object grasping using Vision based detection and motion planning.  
- **Hypergraph Modeling**: Enhanced group recommendation accuracy by using hypergraph probability matrix.
- **Open Source Contributions**: Collaborated on graph-based mathematical model integration as part of a Florida State University research internship.

## My Projects
Here are a few of my key research contributions:

1. [Academic Paper Recommendation System](https://github.com/juyujing/CitationNN)  
   Developed a module that captures directed interaction effectively and apply it to academic recommendation system through directed edge modeling directed citation relationship.
2. [Hexapod Robot for Object Capturing](https://github.com/juyujing/Capturer)  
   Designed a lightweight, bio-inspired hexapod robot with advanced motion planning and vision-based recognition.
3. [Hypergraph Modeling for Group Recommendations](https://github.com/juyujing/HyperGCN)  
   Introduced hypergraph probability matrix that captures higher-order interactions in group-buying scenarios.
4. [Open Source GNNIP Library](https://github.com/juyujing/GrOVe)  
   Contributed to a open source project integrating graph structure based modeling algorithms and enchencing computational efficiency.  

## Skills
While my CV contains a full breakdown of skills, here's a brief snapshot:  
- **Robotics Development**: Proficient in ROS, NVIDIA Jetson platforms.  
- **Data Science Tools**: Familiarity with Hadoop, Spark, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy and Matlab.  
- **Programming**: Advanced in Java, C, C++, Python, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
