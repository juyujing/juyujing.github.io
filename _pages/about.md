I'm Yujing Ju (*pronounced as: Yoo-jing Joo [tɕy˥ y˧˥ tɕiŋ˥˩]*), currently an undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in Robotics at Heriot-Watt University and Computer Science at Ocean University of China. My academic and professional journey has been defined by diverse interdisciplinary projects and a strong foundation in machine learning, graph mining, and robotics.

## Research Projects

### **Graph Neural Networks for Recommendation Systems**
- Designed a [Hypergraph Convolutional Network-based framework](https://github.com/juyujing/HyperGCN) for group recommendation tasks, introducing innovative methods to capture higher-order interactions between users and items. This model improved the accuracy of the state-of-the-art MGBR model by over 5% in user recommendation tasks.
- Current research focuses on [directed and heterogeneous graph neural networks](https://github.com/juyujing/Graduation-Project) to enhance academic citation recommendations. Proposed a novel framework combining spectrum-based directed graph convolution and heterogeneous graph attention mechanisms.

### **Robotics and Biomimetic Systems**
- Led the development of a [biomimetic hexapod robot](https://github.com/juyujing/Capturer) for visually-guided object grasping, integrating YOLO-based object detection with bio-inspired motion planning. This system utilized **Layer-Adaptive Magnitude Pruning** and CUDA optimization for real-time inference.
- Designed versatile gaits inspired by ants and spiders, allowing the robot to adapt to complex terrains and perform efficient locomotion and manipulation.

### **AI and UAV Optimization**
- Optimized UAV path-planning algorithms and lightweight VIO systems during an internship focused on SLAM and AI applications for drones. Reconstructed deprecated libraries and developed efficient simulation environments using Unreal Engine and AirSim.

### **Open Source Contribution**
- As a research intern at [Florida State University's RAI Lab](https://yushundong.github.io), contributed to an [open-source GNN project](https://github.com/GNNIP/GNNIP) by refactoring and integrating models to enhance robustness and streamline deployment.

## Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Scala
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, DGL
- **Robotics Platforms**: ROS, SLAM algorithms (VINS-Fusion, FAST-LIO), NVIDIA Jetson
- **Other Tools**: Matlab, MySQL, Hadoop, Spark, LaTeX, AirSim, Unreal Engine

## Awards and Recognition
- **Innovation and Entrepreneurship Scholarship**, 2022
- **Outstanding Youth Volunteer Award**, 2022

## Beyond Academics
Beyond my technical pursuits, I am passionate about applying interdisciplinary research to solve real-world problems, particularly in recommendation systems, robotics, and AI for healthcare. I believe in the transformative power of technology to enhance lives and aim to contribute meaningfully to cutting-edge developments in these fields.
