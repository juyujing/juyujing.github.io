I'm Yujing Ju, currently an undergraduate at Heriot-Watt University, majoring in Computer Science. My current research area is graph mining. Specifically, I'm deeply engaged in the application of hypergraph neural networks within the domain of group recommendation algorithms. I have expertise in Python, and I excel in utilizing Pytorch, Numpy, Scipy, and other tools to conduct research in the field of machine learning. Inspired by recent developments in Large Artificial Intelligence Model, I'm also keen to further delve into the emerging field of natural language processing.
