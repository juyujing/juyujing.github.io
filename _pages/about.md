I'm Yujing Ju (*pronounced as: Yoo-jing Joo [tɕy˥ y˧˥ tɕiŋ˥˩]*), currently pursuing a dual degree in Robotics at Heriot-Watt University and Computer Science at Ocean University of China. My academic and professional journey is defined by a passion for interdisciplinary research, combining machine learning, graph mining, and robotics to solve complex real-world problems.

## About Me
With hands-on experience in developing scalable machine learning models, I specialize in applying **graph neural networks (GNNs)** and **AI-driven robotics** to fields like recommendation systems and biomimetic engineering. My contributions include publishing innovative research on group recommendation systems, optimizing path-planning algorithms for UAVs, and designing bio-inspired robots.

## Highlights of My Work
- **Hypergraph Neural Networks**: Enhanced group recommendation accuracy by 5% using innovative hypergraph frameworks.  
- **Directed Graph Neural Networks**: Improved academic citation recommendations by capturing overlooked directional relationships.  
- **Biomimetic Robotics**: Developed a hexapod robot capable of efficient locomotion and object grasping using YOLO-based detection and motion planning.  
- **Open Source Contributions**: Collaborated on [graph model robustness](https://github.com/GNNIP/GNNIP) as part of a Florida State University research internship.

## My Projects
Here are a few of my key research contributions:

1. [Hypergraph Neural Network for Group Recommendations](https://github.com/juyujing/HyperGCN)  
   Introduced a hypergraph convolutional network that captures higher-order interactions in group-buying scenarios.  
2. [Hexapod Robot for Object Grasping](https://github.com/juyujing/Capturer)  
   Designed a lightweight, bio-inspired hexapod robot with advanced motion planning and vision-based recognition.  
3. [Open Source GNNIP Library](https://github.com/GNNIP/GNNIP)  
   Contributed to a project enhancing graph neural network deployment and robustness.  
4. [Academic Recommendation System](https://github.com/juyujing/Graduation-Project)  
   Developed a framework combining spectrum-based directed graph convolution and heterogeneous attention networks.

## Skills Overview
While my CV contains a full breakdown of skills, here's a brief snapshot:
- **Machine Learning**: Expertise in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.  
- **Robotics Development**: Proficient in ROS, SLAM (VINS-Fusion, FAST-LIO), and NVIDIA Jetson platforms.  
- **Data Science Tools**: Familiarity with Pandas, Numpy, and Matlab.  
- **Programming**: Advanced in Python, C, and C++.
