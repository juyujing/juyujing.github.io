I'm Yujing Ju, currently a student at Ocean University of China, majoring in Computer Science. My current research area is graph mining. Specifically, I'm deeply engaged in the application of hypergraph neural networks within the domain of group recommendation algorithms. I am proficient in python and good at using Pytorch, Numpy, Scipy and other tools to conduct research in the direction of machine learning. Inspired by recent developments in Large Artificial Intelligence Model, I'm eager to further my explorations in this dynamic field.
